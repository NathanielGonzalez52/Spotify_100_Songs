# Spotify_100_Songs
Uses Spotify API and Beautiful Soup to create a playlist of 100 songs on the user's playlist. 
With Beautiful Soup, the script accesses the Billboard website and obtains the top 100 songs of that date.
Each song is searched in the Spotify API in an attempt to add the song to a playlist. 
If no song is available, the song is passed over.
